## Hi, I'm Safwan Shaikh

Backend-focused Computer Science student working primarily with Java and Spring Boot.
I build backend systems with clear state models, authentication, and persistence, and I’m expanding into cloud-native fundamentals and applied ML.

### What I’m working on
- Backend job orchestration service with task state machines, retries, and worker execution (Spring Boot, PostgreSQL)
- OAuth2 authentication and authorization flows using Spring Security and JWT
- Turning ML pipelines into deployable backend services
- Frontend experimentation with React / Next.js (CityPulse)
- Learning containerization, orchestration, and cloud deployment basics

### Tech stack

**Primary**
- Languages: Java, Python
- Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, REST APIs
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, GraphQL.

**Frontend / Exposure**
- React, Next.js, TypeScript
- Angular (learning), Almost done with it doe hehe

**ML**
- PyTorch, scikit-learn, TenserFlow.

**Cloud & Infrastructure (hands-on basics)**
- Docker, Kubernetes yeah that the fuck else am i supposed to do
- AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure,Hell Yeah Baby 

**Tools**
- Git, Maven

### Selected work
- **Spring Boot OAuth Service**  
  OAuth2, JWT, role-based access, secure API design
- **Job Orchestration Backend**  
  Asynchronous task execution, state management, retries, persistence
- **CityPulse (Frontend)**  
  React / Next.js frontend experimentation.
- **Car Make Recognition Service**  
  Unsupervised ML pipeline with embedding extraction and REST-exposed inference

### Background
- Computer Science Engineering, Brock University (Data Analytics & Software Development)
- Coursework includes DSA, Systems Programming, Computer Architecture, ML & CV
- Prior non-tech roles in high-volume retail environments (reliability, operations).

### Interests
- Backend systems and APIs
- Task scheduling and workflows
- Cloud-native application fundamentals
- Production-grade ML systems
